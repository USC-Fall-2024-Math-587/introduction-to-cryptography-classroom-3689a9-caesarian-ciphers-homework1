## Homework 1

This week we have a written part and an implementation part.

### Written part

Answer the questions found in `written.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them
back here before midnight on the due date. You may do this as many times as
you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be
graded on correctness and

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf.

(Hint: an adapted solution to the implementation could help you answer some
of the questions...)

### Implementation part

Remove the sorries in `hw.lean` to pass the tests. There are more detailed instructions in the comments.

Bonus points: create `better.lean` and have it (maybe)
- prompt the user for the desired shift
- use a custom substition table
- check if a phrase is encoded via Caesar cipher
- properly sanitize the user input
